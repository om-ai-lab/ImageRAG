This rewritten query aims to remove complex references and make the language simpler to understand, while retaining the original meaning of the query.

2024-12-05 21:34:54,192 - my_logger - INFO - Paraphrased Text: The rewritten query would be:

"How many aircraft are moving upwards to the right? What is the color of the building on their left?"

This rewritten query maintains the original meaning and clarity of the query, but simplifies the language and reduces the complexity of the references used.

In the rewritten query, we've assumed that "northeast" means in an up-right direction (positive north-east direction), and "to their southeast" means below or on their left (south-east direction). We've also removed the assumption of the specific location of the building (specifically to their northeast or southeast), but instead, stated that it's on their left.
